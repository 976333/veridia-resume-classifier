 ▶️ How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the resume classifier locally:

 1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/veridiaresumeclassifier.git
cd veridiaresumeclassifier


 2. Set Up Python Virtual Environment
bash
 Create virtual environment
python m venv .venv

 Activate it
 On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

 On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate


 3. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install r requirements.txt


 4. Download the Dataset
 Go to: [Kaggle Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resumedataset)
 Download the fileResume Dataset.csv
 Create a folder nameddata in the project root:
  bash
  mkdir data
  
 Place the downloaded file insidedata/ and rename it to:
  
  resume_dataset.csv
  

✅ Final path:data/resume_dataset.csv

 5. Train the Model
This step preprocesses the data and trains the classifier:
bash
python src/train.py

⏱️ This may take 1–3 minutes.  
✅ On success, youll see accuracy metrics and themodel/ folder will be created.

 6. Run the Web Application
bash
python app/app.py

Youll see:

  Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000


 7. Use the Interface
 Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
 Upload a.txt or.pdf resume file
 View the predicted category, confidence score, and full probability distribution



 📝 Notes
 The app supports PDF and plain text resumes.
 Firsttime setup requires internet (to download NLTK data).
 Do not modify files in themodel/ folder—these are autogenerated during training.

 💡 Troubleshooting
 Issue  Solution 

FileNotFoundError: data/resume_dataset.csv  Ensure the dataset is downloaded and correctly named 
ModuleNotFoundError  Make sure your virtual environment is activated andpip install r requirements.txt was run 
 Low confidence scores  Use resumes with clear domain keywords (e.g., “Python”, “TensorFlow”, “HR policies”) 

✅ Youre ready to classify resumes with AI!
